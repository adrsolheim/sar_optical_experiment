# Comparing LiDAR Pixels To DTM Pixels

- DTM show heights between 35-36m ***above sea level***. 
- LiDAR show heights between 36-55m (*up to 19m above ground*) within tree scene. 
- The pixels below show a height of 45m (*~10m above ground*)

# LiDAR Points In A Single Pixel

Some of these points seem to reflect above sea level values from  
- ground
- mid-canopy 
- **top of canopy**
